## 🎯 Project Overview

### The Problem We Solved
University students often spend **2–3 hours every week** manually creating study schedules, which leads to:  
❌ Unbalanced workloads → stress  
❌ Missed deadlines due to poor planning  
❌ Inefficient time allocation across subjects  
❌ Difficulty adapting plans when priorities change  

### Our AI Solution

🧠 **Reasoning** — analyzing deadlines, difficulty levels, and available hours  
📋 **Planning** — generating optimized daily/weekly study schedules  
⚡ **Executing** — delivering actionable plans via a clean Streamlit web interface  

**Manual Task Automated**
